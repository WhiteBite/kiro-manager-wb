## What is this

Extension for Kiro IDE that allows you to:

- **Store multiple accounts** and switch between them in one click
- **See usage** for each account — requests spent, remaining, reset time
- **Auto-register new accounts** directly from the interface (requires email with IMAP)
- **Refresh tokens** — manually or automatically before expiration
- **Export account list** to JSON
- **Copy tokens and passwords** to clipboard

All this lives in a convenient sidebar panel with a proper UI, not in the console like savages.

---

## How it works

### Account switching

Kiro stores the auth token in its internal database (`state.vscdb`). The extension:

1. Reads tokens from `~/.kiro-extension/tokens/`
2. On switch — writes the selected token to Kiro's database
3. Kiro picks up the new token and works under a different account

No IDE restart needed. Switching takes a couple of seconds.

### Usage tracking

The extension reads usage data from the same Kiro database and shows:

- Current request usage
- Account limit
- Usage percentage
- Time until limit reset

Data is cached locally, so even after switching to another account — you can see stats for all of them.

### Auto-registration

The juiciest part. The extension can automatically:

1. Generate an email on the specified domain
2. Open a browser (Playwright)
3. Complete registration on AWS/Kiro
4. Get verification code from email via IMAP
5. Enter the code, complete registration
6. Save the token to the tokens folder

All without human intervention. Well, almost — sometimes there's a captcha.

## Installation

### From release (recommended)

1. Download `.vsix` from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Open Kiro
3. `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Extensions: Install from VSIX`
4. Select the downloaded file
5. Restart Kiro

### From source

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd kiro-extension
npm install
npm run package
```

You'll get `kiro-account-switcher-X.X.X.vsix` — install as above.

| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `imap.server`         | IMAP server address              | `mail.example.com`  |
| `imap.user`           | Login (usually email)            | `admin@example.com` |
| `imap.password`       | Password                         | `***`               |
| `autoreg.emailDomain` | Domain for generating emails     | `example.com`       |
| `autoreg.headless`    | Hide browser during registration | `false`             |

## Token format

Tokens are stored in `~/.kiro-extension/tokens/` as JSON files:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...",
  "refreshToken": "eyJjdHkiOiJKV1QiLCJlbmMiOi...",
  "expiresAt": "2024-12-10T20:00:00.000Z",
  "accountName": "user@example.com",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "idToken": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6..."
}
```

Filename can be anything, extension `.json`. The extension reads all files from the folder.

You can add tokens manually — just drop a JSON file into the folder and click Refresh.

## Using auto-registration

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Mail server with IMAP access
- Domain for emails (catch-all or individual mailboxes)

### First run

1. Configure IMAP in extension settings
2. Click **Auto-Reg** button in the panel
3. Wait — on first run, dependencies will be installed:
   - `playwright` (browser)
   - `imapclient` (email handling)
   - and others from `requirements.txt`
4. Browser will open, registration will proceed
5. On success — token will appear in the list

### What can go wrong

- **Captcha** — sometimes AWS shows captcha. Solve manually or restart.
- **Email not arriving** — check IMAP settings, look at logs.
- **Browser not opening** — check Playwright is installed: `playwright install chromium`
- **Python not found** — make sure `python` or `python3` is in PATH.

Logs are written to `~/.kiro-extension/autoreg.log` and extension console.

## Known issues

- **Usage sometimes doesn't update** — click Refresh or wait. Kiro caches data.
- **Auto-reg hangs on captcha** — AWS sometimes requires captcha. Solve manually or restart.
- **Linux needs python3** — make sure symlink exists or configure PATH.
- **Token not applying** — try restarting Kiro. Rare, but happens.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this legal?**  
A: This is an educational project. Read the disclaimer above.

**Q: Will I get banned?**  
A: Possibly. Read the disclaimer above.

**Q: Why Python for auto-reg?**  
A: Because Playwright in Python is more convenient for this kind of automation, plus there was existing code.

**Q: Can I use it without auto-reg?**  
A: Yes. Just don't configure IMAP and don't click the button. Account switching works independently.

**Q: How to add an existing account?**  
A: Log into Kiro, find the token in `state.vscdb`, save as JSON to tokens folder. Or use Import.
